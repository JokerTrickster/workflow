# Issue #32 Analysis: Activity Logging System

## Task Summary
Implement activity logging for repository connections, task actions, and GitHub synchronization events.

## Work Stream Analysis

### Stream A: Activity Service Implementation (Backend)
**Scope**: Core activity logging service and data models
**Agent**: backend-architect
**Files**: 
- `frontend/src/services/ActivityLogger.ts` (create)
- `frontend/src/types/activity.ts` (create)

**Work**:
- Log repository connection/disconnection events
- Log task creation/completion linked to GitHub items  
- Log GitHub data synchronization events
- Event-driven logging with structured data

**Dependencies**: Task #30 completed (LogsTab foundation) ✅

### Stream B: Logs Tab Enhancement (Frontend)
**Scope**: Replace LogsTab placeholder with real activity display
**Agent**: frontend-architect
**Files**:
- `frontend/src/presentation/components/tabs/LogsTab.tsx` (enhance existing)
- Activity display components

**Work**:
- Display chronological activity feed in Logs tab
- Filter logs by date range, action type, repository
- Export logs functionality
- Empty state when no activity exists

**Dependencies**: Stream A completion (needs activity service)

## Current State Analysis
From Task #30 completion:
- LogsTab placeholder exists with mock data structure ✅
- Tab infrastructure ready ✅
- Filter and export functionality outlined ✅

**What needs implementation**:
- Real activity logging service
- Data persistence (localStorage for now)
- Integration with existing workflows
- Real activity feed display

## Parallel Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. **Stream A**: Activity service and data models

### Phase 2: Integration  
2. **Stream B**: LogsTab enhancement with real activity service

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Activity logging service captures repository events
- [ ] Task creation/completion events logged with GitHub metadata
- [ ] GitHub synchronization events tracked
- [ ] LogsTab displays real activity feed with filtering
- [ ] Export logs functionality works
- [ ] Activity persists across sessions
