# Stream B: State Management - Issue #28

## Progress Update

**Current Status**: Implementation Complete

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Analyzed existing codebase structure
- [x] Identified Repository entity has `is_connected` field  
- [x] Located RepositoryCard component that expects connect/disconnect callbacks
- [x] Found existing GitHubApiService for fetching repositories
- [x] Confirmed React Query setup with QueryProvider
- [x] Created useRepositories hook with React Query integration
- [x] Implemented connect/disconnect mutations with React Query
- [x] Added localStorage persistence for connection status
- [x] Added comprehensive test coverage (7 tests passing)
- [x] Verified all functionality works as expected

**Integration Ready**:
- [x] Hook provides all required methods for Stream A components
- [x] Connection status persists across page refreshes
- [x] State management follows existing patterns
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Technical Analysis

### Current State
- Repository entity already has optional `is_connected?: boolean` field
- GitHubApiService sets `is_connected: false` by default  
- RepositoryCard expects `onConnect` and `onDisconnect` callbacks
- React Query is properly set up with error handling

### Implementation Summary
1. ✅ Created `useRepositories` hook with:
   - React Query integration for fetching repositories from GitHub API
   - Local state management for connection status
   - Connect/disconnect mutations with optimistic updates
   - localStorage persistence for connection states
   - Comprehensive error handling and loading states
   
2. ✅ Connection state management:
   - In-memory state with localStorage backup
   - No database table needed (GitHub API data is ephemeral)
   - Connection status survives page refreshes
   - Clean separation of concerns

### Integration Points (Ready for Stream A)
✅ Hook provides all expected methods:
- `connectRepository(repoId, localPath?)` - Stream A can call this
- `disconnectRepository(repoId)` - Stream A can call this  
- `repositories` array with merged connection status
- `getConnectionStatus(repoId)` for specific repository status
- Loading and error states for UI feedback

## Files Created/Modified
- ✅ `frontend/src/hooks/useRepositories.ts` (new hook)
- ✅ `frontend/src/__tests__/hooks/useRepositories.test.tsx` (comprehensive tests)
- ✅ Database types are sufficient (Repository entity already has is_connected field)
