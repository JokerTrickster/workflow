# Stream A: API Service Extension

## Scope
Core GitHub API method implementation for Issues and Pull Requests

## Files
- `frontend/src/services/GitHubApiService.ts`

## Progress
- ✅ Analyzed existing GitHubApiService structure and patterns
- ✅ Added temporary GitHubIssue and GitHubPullRequest interface types
- ✅ Implemented rate limiting with exponential backoff (makeApiRequest helper)
- ✅ Refactored existing methods to use new rate limiting
- ✅ Implemented `fetchRepositoryIssues(repoId, page?, perPage?, state?)` method
- ✅ Implemented `fetchRepositoryPullRequests(repoId, page?, perPage?, state?)` method
- ✅ Added proper pagination support with Link header parsing
- ✅ Added input validation for repoId format
- ✅ Filtered out PRs from issues endpoint (GitHub API quirk)

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Rate Limiting**: Exponential backoff with 3 retries (2s, 4s, 8s delays)
- **Error Recovery**: Handles 403 rate limits, 5xx server errors, network failures
- **Pagination**: Uses GitHub Link headers to detect next page availability
- **Validation**: Ensures repoId follows "owner/repo" format
- **Filtering**: Issues endpoint excludes pull requests by URL pattern matching

## Completion Summary
All acceptance criteria have been successfully implemented:

✅ **fetchRepositoryIssues(repoId, page?)** - Implemented with optional state and perPage parameters
✅ **fetchRepositoryPullRequests(repoId, page?)** - Implemented with optional state and perPage parameters  
✅ **Pagination support** - Uses GitHub Link headers for proper pagination
✅ **Rate limiting with exponential backoff** - Centralized makeApiRequest with 3-retry strategy
✅ **Error recovery for GitHub API failures** - Handles auth, rate limits, server errors, and network issues

The implementation follows existing GitHubApiService patterns and is ready for integration with React components. Stream B will provide specific TypeScript interfaces to replace the temporary generic types used here.
