# Stream B Progress: TaskTab Component Enhancement

## Status: In Progress

## Completed Tasks:
- [x] Analyzed existing TaskTab placeholder in WorkspacePanel
- [x] Reviewed GitHub API service from Task #29 
- [x] Reviewed GitHub type definitions
- [x] Reviewed existing React Query patterns in useRepositories hook

## Current Tasks:
- [x] Create GitHub Issues React Query hook
- [x] Create GitHub Pull Requests React Query hook  
- [x] Extract TaskTab component from WorkspacePanel
- [x] Enhance TaskTab with GitHub Issues display
- [x] Enhance TaskTab with GitHub Pull Requests display
- [x] Add filtering and search functionality
- [x] Add task creation integration
- [ ] Test GitHub API integration with real data
- [ ] Verify error handling and edge cases

## Technical Implementation:

### GitHub API Integration:
- Using `fetchRepositoryIssues()` and `fetchRepositoryPullRequests()` from Task #29
- Following existing React Query patterns from `useRepositories.ts`
- Repository context passed from WorkspacePanel

### UI Design:
- Issues and PRs displayed in separate tabs/sections within TaskTab
- State badges (open/closed/merged)
- Clickable GitHub links
- Filter controls (state, search)
- "Create Task" integration buttons

### File Structure:
- `/presentation/components/tabs/TaskTab.tsx` - Main enhanced component ✅ CREATED
- `/hooks/useGitHubIssues.ts` - Issues data fetching ✅ CREATED
- `/hooks/useGitHubPullRequests.ts` - PRs data fetching ✅ CREATED

### Implementation Details:

#### Enhanced TaskTab Component:
- **Three Sub-tabs**: Tasks, Issues, PRs (matching requirements)
- **GitHub Issues Tab**: 
  - Real-time data fetching from GitHub API
  - State filtering (all/open/closed)
  - Search functionality
  - Issue badges with proper styling
  - "Create Task" integration for each issue
  - Links to GitHub with external link indicators
- **GitHub Pull Requests Tab**:
  - Real-time data fetching from GitHub API
  - State filtering (all/open/closed/merged)
  - Search functionality
  - PR badges with branch information
  - "Create Task" integration for each PR
  - Merged/closed/open state indicators
- **Local Tasks Tab**: 
  - Preserved existing task functionality
  - Task creation dialog
  - Status management and execution

#### React Query Hooks:
- **useGitHubIssues**: Issues fetching with caching, error handling, retry logic
- **useGitHubPullRequests**: PRs fetching with caching, error handling, retry logic
- **Smart Loading**: Only fetches data when tab is active and repository is connected
- **Error Handling**: Proper auth token validation and user-friendly error messages

#### UI/UX Features:
- **Loading States**: Proper loading spinners and skeleton states
- **Empty States**: Informative messages for no data scenarios
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with retry functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with proper breakpoints
- **Search & Filtering**: Real-time search with state-based filtering
- **Task Integration**: Seamless task creation from GitHub issues/PRs

## Next Steps:
1. Test with real GitHub data and authentication
2. Verify error handling for various API scenarios
3. Test repository connection/disconnection states
4. Validate task creation workflow from GitHub items
