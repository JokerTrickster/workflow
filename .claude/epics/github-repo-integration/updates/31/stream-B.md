# Stream B: GitHub Data Display Enhancement

## Scope
Enhanced GitHub Issues/PR display with task integration

## Files
- `frontend/src/presentation/components/tabs/TaskTab.tsx` (enhanced) ✅

## Progress
### ✅ Completed Features

#### Enhanced Visual Display
- **Improved Status Badges**: Better color coding with border styling for issues (open/completed/closed) and PRs (open/draft/merged/closed)
- **Task Linkage Indicators**: Visual badges showing how many local tasks are linked to each GitHub item
- **Enhanced PR Information**: Draft status, merge indicators, diff stats (additions/deletions), commit counts
- **Better Timestamp Display**: Shows both creation and update dates when different

#### Advanced Filtering System
- **Collapsible Filters Panel**: Advanced filters can be toggled on/off to save screen space
- **Multi-dimensional Filtering**:
  - Label filtering with color-coded label selector
  - Assignee/Reviewer filtering with avatar previews
  - Task linkage filtering (all/linked/unlinked)
- **Enhanced Search**: Searches across titles, content, authors, and branch names (PRs)
- **Filter State Management**: Clear all filters functionality with visual filter count

#### Enhanced User Information
- **Assignee Display**: Shows assignees with stacked avatars (up to 3 visible, with overflow indicator)
- **Reviewer Display**: Shows requested reviewers for PRs with similar avatar stacking
- **Author Information**: User avatars in metadata sections
- **Interactive Elements**: Tooltips on avatars showing usernames

#### Context-Aware Task Creation
- **Smart Button States**: "Create Task" vs "Add Another Task" based on existing linked tasks
- **Visual Context**: Blue styling for items that already have linked tasks

#### Better Content Organization
- **Hierarchical Badge Layout**: Primary badges (status, linkage) separated from secondary info (assignees, comments)
- **Label Management**: Shows up to 4 labels with overflow indicator, improved styling with label colors
- **Responsive Design**: Improved mobile layout for all new filtering components

### Technical Implementation
- Added 15+ new icon imports for enhanced visual elements
- Implemented helper functions for task linkage detection
- Created dynamic filter data extraction from current GitHub data
- Enhanced TypeScript typing for filter states
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Integration Points
- ✅ Works with existing TaskCreationForm from Stream A
- ✅ Integrates with GitHub API hooks from Task #29
- ✅ Maintains existing local task management functionality
